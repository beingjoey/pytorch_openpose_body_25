# pytorch_openpose_body_25
pytorch implementation of openpose including Body coco and body_25 Estimation, and the pytorch model is directly converted from openpose caffemodel by caffemodel2pytorch.I did some work to implement the body_25 net model and to figure out the correspond of Part Confidence Map and Part Affinity Field outputs. Some code came from PyTorch OpenPose, and I debug some problem.

Download the torch model ,and put them in the model folder(mkdir by yourself)
